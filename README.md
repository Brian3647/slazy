SSSignals is a lightweight Rust library that provides simple, synchronous reactive signals. Signals are a powerful way to react to changes in values and design event-driven systems. With SSSignals, you can easily incorporate reactive programming into your Rust applications.

## Features

-   üì° **Signal Creation**: Create signals to hold values of any data type.
-   üîÑ **Value Change Callbacks**: Register callbacks that are triggered when the signal's value changes.
-   üó∫ **Value Transformation**: Map the signal's value to a new value using a provided mapping function.
-   üéØ **Trait Implementations**: Implements common Rust traits such as `Display`, `Debug`, and `Default`.

## Usage

```rust
use sssignals::Signal;

fn main() {
    let mut signal = Signal::new(42);

    signal.on_change(|new, old| {
        println!("Value changed from {} to {}", old, new);
    });

    signal.set(43); // Prints "Value changed from 42 to 43"

    println!("{}", signal); // Prints "Signal(43)"
}
```

## Installation

Run `cargo add sssignals` or add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
